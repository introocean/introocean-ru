% \chapter{Coastal Processes and Tides} 
В предыдущей главе я описывал волны на поверхности моря. Теперь мы
можем рассмотреть нескоторые важные особенности: трансформация и
разрушение волн при подходе их к побережью; течения и (краевые) волны
возникшие в результате взаимодействия волн с берегом; цунами;
штормовые нагоны; приливные явления, особенно вблизи берега.
%
% In the last chapter I described waves on the sea surface. Now we can
% consider several special and important cases: the transformation of
% waves as they come ashore and break; the currents and edge waves
% generated by the interaction of waves with coasts;
% tsunamis\index{tsunami}; storm surges; and tides, especially tides
% along coasts and in the deep ocean.

\begin{section}{Волны на Мелководье и Прибрежные Процессы}
% \section{Shoaling Waves and Coastal Processes}
Фаза волны и групповая скорость~--- есть функции от глубины, если
глубина меньше примерно четверти длины волны в глубоком океане. Период
волны и частота инвариантны (не изменяются при подходе волны к
берегу); это используется при расчётах свойств прибрежных волн. Высота
волны увеличивается при уменьшении групповой скорости волн. Днина
волны уменьшается. Направление волн меняется вследствие рефракции. И,
наконец, на мелководье волны разрушаются, создавая в зоне прибоя
long-shore and rip currents.
%
% \index{waves!shoaling}Wave phase and group velocities are a function
% of depth when the depth is less than about one-quarter wavelength in
% deep water. Wave period and frequency are invariant (don't change as
% the wave comes ashore); and this is used to compute the properties of
% shoaling waves. Wave height increases as wave group velocity
% slows. Wave length decreases. Waves change direction due to
% refraction. Finally, waves break if the water is sufficiently shallow;
% and broken waves pour water into the surf zone, creating long-shore
% and rip currents\index{rip currents}.

\begin{paragraph}{Прибрежные волны.}
% \paragraph{Shoaling Waves}
Дисперсионное соотношение (16.3) используется для расчёта свойств
волны, которая распространяется от глубоководных районов к мелководью
вне зоны прибоя. Так как $\omega$ постоянна, (16.3) то:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{L_{0}} = \frac{c}{c_{0}}=\frac{\sin \alpha }{\sin \alpha _{0}} = \tanh
\frac{2 \pi d}{L} \label{eq:intermed}
\end{equation}
где
\begin{equation}
L_{0} = \frac{g T^{2}}{2 \pi }, \qquad c_{0} = \frac{g T}{2 \pi } \label{eq:Lzero}
\end{equation}
$L$~--- длина волны, $c$~--- фазовая скорость, $\alpha $~--- угол
между гребнем и контурами изобаты, $d$~--- глубина моря. Индексом~$0$
отмечены значения для глубокого моря.
%
% The dispersion relation (16.3) is used to calculate wave properties as
% the waves propagate from deep water offshore to shallow water just
% outside the surf zone. Because $\omega$ is constant, (16.3) leads to:
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{L}{L_{0}} = \frac{c}{c_{0}}=\frac{\sin \alpha }{\sin \alpha _{0}} = \tanh
% \frac{2 \pi d}{L} \label{eq:intermed}
% \end{equation}
% where
% \begin{equation}
% L_{0} = \frac{g T^{2}}{2 \pi }, \qquad c_{0} = \frac{g T}{2 \pi } \label{eq:Lzero}
% \end{equation}
% and $L$ is wave length, $c$ is phase velocity, $\alpha $ is the angle
% of the crest relative to contours of constant depth, and $d$ is water
% depth. The subscript $0$ indicates values in deep water.

Величина $d/L$ расчитывается из решения
\begin{equation}

Вейгеля (Wiegel, 1964).

Так как скорость волны является функцией глубины в мелком воде,
изменение глубины при подходе волны к берегу может сфокусировать или
расфокусировать энергию волны. Рассмотрим простой случай, когда
гребень волны почти параллелен берегу с двумя мысами, которые, уходя
под воду, образуют отметь (рисунок 17.2). Групповая скорость волн
больше в глубокой части между отмелями, и гребень начинает
деформироваться придлижаясь к берегу. Энергия волны, распространяясь
перпендикулярно гребню волны, направляется в сторону мысов, где прибой
становится гораздо сильнее, чем в заливе. Различия высот молн могут
быть необычайно большими. В спокойный день прибой может быть крошечным
вдоль подводного каньона близ La Jolla Shores, California, южнее
Института Океанографии Scripps. В то же самое время немного севернее
каньона волны могут быть достаточно высокими, чтобы заинтересовать
любителей сёрфинга.
%
% Because wave velocity is a function of depth in shallow water,
% variations in offshore water depth can focus or defocus wave energy
% reaching the shore. Consider the simple case of waves with deep-water
% crests almost parallel to a straight beach with two ridges each
% extending seaward from a headland (figure 17.2). Wave group velocity
% is faster in the deeper water between the ridges, and the wave crests
% become progressively deformed as the wave propagates toward the
% beach. Wave energy, which propagates perpendicular to wave crests, is
% refracted out of the region between the headland. As a result, wave
% energy is focused into the headlands, and
% breakers\index{breakers!height of} there are much larger than breakers
% in the bay. The difference in wave height can be surprisingly
% large. On a calm day, breakers can be knee high shoreward of a
% submarine canyon at La Jolla Shores, California, just south of the
% Scripps Institution of Oceanography. At the same time, waves just
% north of the canyon can be high enough to attract surfers.

\begin{paragraph}{Разрушение волн}
% \paragraph{Breaking Waves}
При движении волн на мелководье их групповая скорость уменьшается,
энергия на квадратный метр поверхности моря увеличивается, и в
уравнении волны становятся важными нелинейные периоды. В результате
волны начинают расти, приобретая вид узкого крутого гребня с широкой
пологой ложбиной. Когда крутизна волны становится достаточно большой,
волна разрушается (Рисунок 17.3 слева). Форма разрушающейся волны
зависит от уклона дна, и крутизны волны при подходе к берегу (Рисунок
17.3 справа).
%
% \index{waves!breaking}As waves move into shallow water, the group
% velocity becomes small, wave energy per square meter of sea surface
% increases, and non-linear terms in the wave equations become
% important. These processes cause waves to steepen, with short steep
% crests and broad shallow troughs. When wave slope at the crest becomes
% sufficiently steep, the wave breaks (figure 17.3 Right). The shape of
% the breaking wave depends on the slope of the bottom, and the
% steepness of waves offshore (figure 17.3 Left).
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Steep waves tend to lose energy slowly as the waves moves into
shallower water through water spilling down the front of the
wave. These are spilling breakers\index{breakers!spilling}.

\item
If the beach is sufficiently steep, the wave can
surge\index{breakers!surging} up the face of the beach without
breaking in the sense that white water is formed. Or if it is formed,
it is at the leading edge of the water as it surges up the beach. An
extreme example would be a wave incident on a vertical breakwater.

attached to the beach, an edge wave. The waves have periods of a few
minutes, a long-shore wave length of around a kilometer, and an
amplitude that decays exponentially offshore (figure 17.6).

% \section{Tsunamis}
\index{tsunamis|textbf}Tsunamis are low-frequency ocean waves
generated by submarine earthquakes. The sudden motion of sea floor
over distances of a hundred or more kilometers generates waves with
periods of 15--40 minutes (figure 17.7). A quick calculation shows
that such waves must be shallow-water waves, propagating at a speed of
180 m/s and having a wavelength of 130 km in water 3.6 km deep (figure
17.8). The waves are not noticeable at sea, but after slowing on
approach to the coast, and after refraction by sub-sea features, they
can come ashore and surge to heights ten or more meters above sea
level. In an extreme example, the great 2004 Indian Ocean
tsunami\index{tsunami!Indian Ocean} destroyed hundreds of villages,
killing at least 200,000 people.

\textsc{most} model (Titov and Gonzalez, 1997). The model uses nested
grids to resolve the tsunami wavelength, it propagates the wave across
ocean basins, and then calculates run-up when the wave comes
ashore. It is initialized from a ground deformation model that uses
measured earthquake magnitude and location to calculate vertical
displacement of the sea floor. The forcing is modified once waves are
measured near the earthquake by seafloor observing stations.

Earth's crust is elastic. It bends under the influence of the tidal

Oceanic tides lag behind the tide-generating potential. This produces
forces that transfer angular momentum between earth and the tide

tidal forces, earth's rotation about it's axis slows, increasing the
length of day; the rotation of the moon about earth slows, causing the
moon to move slowly away from earth; and moon's rotation about it's
axis slows, causing the moon to keep the same side facing earth as the
moon rotates about earth.

Mariners have known for at least four thousand years that tides are
related to the phase of the moon\index{moon}. The exact relationship,
however, is hidden behind many complicating factors, and some of the
greatest scientific minds of the last four centuries worked to
understand, calculate, and predict tides. Galileo, Descartes, Kepler,
Newton, Euler, Bernoulli, Kant, Laplace, Airy, Lord Kelvin, Jeffreys,
Munk and many others contributed. Some of the first computers were
developed to compute and predict tides. Ferrel built a tide-predicting
machine in 1880 that was used by the U.S. Coast Survey to predict
nineteen tidal constituents. In 1901, Harris extended the capacity to
37 constituents.

Despite all this work important questions remained: What is the
amplitude and phase of the tides at any place on the ocean or along
the coast? What is the speed and direction of tidal currents?  What is
the shape of the tides on the ocean?  Where is tidal energy
dissipated? Finding answers to these simple questions is difficult,
and the first, accurate, global maps of deep-sea tides were only
published in 1994 (LeProvost et al. 1994). The problem is hard because
the tides are a self-gravitating, near-resonant, sloshing of water in
a rotating, elastic, ocean basin with ridges, mountains, and submarine
basins.

\index{tidal!potential}Tides are calculated from the hydrodynamic
equations for a self-gravitating ocean on a rotating, elastic
earth. The driving force is the gradient of the gravity field of the
moon\index{moon} and sun. If the earth were an ocean planet with no
land, and if we ignore the influence of inertia and currents, the
gravity gradient produces a pair of bulges of water on earth, one on
the side facing the moon or sun, one on the side away from the moon or
sun. A clear derivation of the forces is given by Pugh (1987) and by
Dietrich, Kalle, Krauss, and Siedler (1980). Here I follow the
discussion in Pugh (1987: \S 3.2).

Note that many oceanographic books state that the tide is produced by
two processes: i) the centripetal acceleration at earth's surface as
the earth and moon circle around a common center of mass, and ii) the
gravitational attraction of mass on earth and the moon. However, the
derivation of the tidal potential does not involve centripetal
acceleration, and the concept is not used by the astronomical or
geodetic communities.

To calculate the amplitude and phase of the tide on an ocean planet,
we begin by calculating the tide-generating
potential\index{tidal!potential}. This is much easier than calculating
the forces. Ignoring for now earth's rotation, the rotation of
moon\index{moon} about earth produces a potential $V_M$ at any point
on earth's surface
\begin{equation}
V_{M} = -\frac{\gamma M}{r_{1}}
\end{equation}
where the geometry is sketched in figure 17.10, $\gamma $ is the
gravitational constant, and $M$ is moon's mass. From the triangle
$OPA$ in the figure,
\begin{equation}
r_{1}^{2} = r^{2} + R^{2} - 2 r R \cos \varphi
\end{equation}
Using this in (17.5) gives
\begin{equation}
V_{M} = -\frac{\gamma M}{R} \left\{ 1 - 2 \left(\frac{r}{R}\right) \cos \varphi +
\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^{2}\right\}^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
$r/R \approx 1/60$, and (17.7) may be expanded in powers of $r/R$
using Legendre polynomials (Whittaker and Watson, 1963: \S 15.1):
\begin{equation}
V_M = -\frac{\gamma M}{R} \left\{1+\left(\frac{r}{R}\right) \cos \varphi +
\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (3\cos ^2 \varphi - 1) + \cdots
\right\}
\end{equation}
The tidal forces are calculated from the spatial gradient of the
potential. The first term in (17.8) produces no force. The second
term, when differentiated with respect to ($r \cos \varphi $) produces
a constant force $\gamma M/R^{2}$ parallel to OA that keeps earth in
orbit around the center of mass of the earth-moon system. The third
term produces the tides, assuming the higher-order terms can be
ignored. The tide-generating potential is therefore:
\begin{equation}
V= -\frac{\gamma M r^{2}}{2 R^{3}} (3 \cos ^2 \varphi - 1)
\end{equation}

The tide-generating force can be decomposed into components
perpendicular $P$ and parallel $H$ to the sea surface. Tides are
produced by the horizontal component. ``The vertical component is
balanced by pressure on the sea bed, but the ratio of the horizontal
force per unit mass to vertical gravity has to be balanced by an
opposing slope of the sea surface, as well as by possible changes in
current momentum'' (Cartwright, 1999: 39, 45). The horizontal
component, shown in figure 17.11, is:
\begin{equation}
H = - \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial V}{\partial\varphi} = \frac{2 G}{r} \sin
2\varphi
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{3}{4} \gamma M \left( \frac{r^{2}}{R^{3}} \right)
\end{equation}
The tidal potential is symmetric about the earth-moon\index{moon}
line, and it produces symmetric bulges.

If we allow our ocean-covered earth to rotate, an observer in space
sees the two bulges fixed relative to the earth-moon line as earth
rotates. To an observer on earth, the two tidal bulges seems to rotate
around earth because moon appears to move around the sky at nearly one
cycle per day. Moon produces high tides every 12 hours and 25.23
minutes on the equator if the moon is above the equator. Notice that
high tides are not exactly twice per day because the moon is also
rotating around earth. Of course, the moon is above the equator only
twice per lunar month, and this complicates our simple picture of the
tides on an ideal ocean-covered earth.  Furthermore, moon's distance
from earth $R$ varies because moon's orbit is elliptical and because
the elliptical orbit is not fixed.

Clearly, the calculation of tides is getting more complicated than we
might have thought. Before continuing on, we note that the solar tidal
forces are derived in a similar way. The relative importance of the
sun and moon are nearly the same.  Although the sun is much more
massive than moon\index{moon}, it is much further away.

Moon's orbit is also elliptical, but a description of moon's orbit is
much more complicated than a description of earth's orbit. Here are
the basics. The moon's orbit lies in a plane inclined at a mean angle
of $\degrees{5.15}$ relative to the plane of the ecliptic. And lunar
declination varies between $\delta = \degrees{23.45 \pm 5.15}$ with a
period of one tropical month of 27.32 solar days. The actual
inclination of moon's orbit varies between $\degrees{4.97}$, and
$\degrees{5.32}$.

The shape of moon's orbit also varies. First, perigee rotates with a
period of 8.85 years. The eccentricity of the orbit has a mean value
of 0.0549, and it varies between 0.044 and 0.067. Second, the plane of
moon's orbit rotates around earth's axis of rotation with a period of
18.613 years. Both processes cause variations in $R_{moon}$.

Note that I am a little imprecise in defining the position of the sun
and moon.  Lang (1980: \S \ 5.1.2) gives much more precise
definitions.

Substituting (17.15) into (17.9) gives:
\begin{multline}
V = \frac{\gamma M r^{2}}{R^{3}} \frac{1}{4} \left[ \left( 3 \sin ^{2} \varphi_p - 1
 \right) \left( 3 \sin ^{2} \delta -1 \right)  \right. \\
 + 3 \sin 2 \varphi_p \,\, \sin 2 \delta \,\, \cos \tau _{1} \\
 + \left. 3 \cos^2 \varphi_p \,\, \cos^2 \delta \,\, \cos 2 \tau _1 \right]
\end{multline}
Equation (17.16) separates the period of the lunar tidal potential
into three terms with periods near 14 days, 24 hours, and 12
hours. Similarly the solar potential has periods near 180 days, 24
hours, and 12 hours. Thus there are three distinct groups of tidal
frequencies: twice-daily, daily, and long period, having different
latitudinal factors $\sin^2 \theta $, $\sin 2 \theta$, and $(1 - 3
\cos^2 \theta )/2$, where $\theta $ is the co-latitude $\left(
90^{\circ} - \varphi \right) $.

Doodson (1922) expanded (17.16) in a Fourier series using the cleverly
chosen frequencies in table 17.1. Other choices of fundamental
frequencies are possible, for example the local, mean, solar time can
be used instead of the local, mean, lunar time. Doodson's expansion,
however, leads to an elegant decomposition of tidal constituents into
groups with similar frequencies and spatial variability.

and assume no land (Cartwright 1999: 274), the largest tidal
constituents would have amplitudes given in table 17.2. Notice that
tides with frequencies near one or two cycles per day are split into
closely spaced lines with spacing separated by a cycle per month. Each
of these lines is further split into lines separated by a cycle per
year (figure 17.12). Furthermore, each of these lines is split into
lines separated by a cycle per 8.8 yr, and so on. Clearly, there are

Why is the tide split into the many constituents shown in figure
17.12? To answer the question, suppose moon's elliptical orbit was in
the equatorial plane of earth. Then $\delta = 0$. From (17.16), the
tidal potential on the equator, where $\varphi_p =0$, is:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{\gamma M r^{2}}{R^{3}} \frac{1}{4} \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right)
\end{equation}
If the ellipticity of the orbit is small, $R= R_0 (1+\epsilon )$, and
(17.18) is approximately
\begin{equation}
V = a (1-3\epsilon) \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right)
\end{equation}
where $a=\left( \gamma M r^2 \right)/\left( 4 R^3 \right)$ is a
constant.  $\epsilon$ varies with a period of 27.32 days, and we can
write $\epsilon = b \cos (2 \pi f_2)$ where $b$ is a small
constant. With these simplifications, (17.19) can be written:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
V &= a \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right) -3 a b \cos \left( 2 \pi f_2 \right) \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right) \\
V &= a \cos \left(4\pi f_1 \right) - 3 a b \left[ \cos 2\pi \left( 2f_1 - f_2 \right) + \cos 2\pi \left( 2f_1 + f_2 \right) \right]
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
which has a spectrum with three lines at $2 f_1$ and $ 2 f_1 \pm
f_2$. Therefore, the slow modulation of the amplitude of the tidal
potential at two cycles per lunar day causes the potential to be split
into three frequencies. This is the way amplitude modulated AM radio
works. If we add in the slow changes in the shape of the orbit, we get
still more terms even in this very idealized case of a
moon\index{moon} in an equatorial orbit.
%
% Why is the tide split into the many constituents shown in figure
% 17.12? To answer the question, suppose moon's elliptical orbit was in
% the equatorial plane of earth. Then $\delta = 0$. From (17.16), the
% tidal potential on the equator, where $\varphi_p =0$, is:
% \begin{equation}
% V = \frac{\gamma M r^{2}}{R^{3}} \frac{1}{4} \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right)
% \end{equation}
% If the ellipticity of the orbit is small, $R= R_0 (1+\epsilon )$, and
% (17.18) is approximately
% \begin{equation}
% V = a (1-3\epsilon) \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right)
% \end{equation}
% where $a=\left( \gamma M r^2 \right)/\left( 4 R^3 \right)$ is a
% constant.  $\epsilon$ varies with a period of 27.32 days, and we can
% write $\epsilon = b \cos (2 \pi f_2)$ where $b$ is a small
% constant. With these simplifications, (17.19) can be written:
% \begin{subequations}
% \begin{align}

If you are very observant, you will have noticed that the tidal
spectrum in figure 17.12 does not look like the ocean-wave spectrum of
ocean waves in figure 16.6. Ocean waves have all possible frequencies,
and their spectrum is continuous. Tides have precise frequencies
determined by the orbit of earth and moon\index{moon}, and their

Doodson's expansion included 399 constituents, of which 100 are long

\item 
The ocean basins have a natural resonance close to the tidal
frequencies. The tidal bulge is a shallow-water wave on a rotating
ocean, and it propagates as a high tide rotating around the edge of
the basin. Thus the tides are a nearly resonant sloshing of water in
the ocean basin. The actual tide heights in deep water can be higher
than the equilibrium values noted in table 17.2.

Tides are dissipated by bottom friction especially in shallow seas, by

\item 
Because the tide is a shallow-water wave everywhere, its velocity
depends on depth.  Tides propagate more slowly over mid-ocean ridges
and shallow seas. Hence, the distance between grid points in numerical
models must be proportional to depth with very close spacing on
continental shelves (LeProvost et al. 1994).

the tidal record is shorter than 8 years, the altimeter data are used

Tides are important for navigation; they influence accurate geodetic
measurements; and they change the orbits and rotation of planets,
moons, and stars in galaxies.

\item 
Tides are produced by a combination of time-varying gravitational
potential of the moon and sun and the centrifugal forces generated as
earth rotates about the common center of mass of the earth-moon-sun
system.

Tides have six fundamental frequencies. The tide is the superposition
of hundreds of tidal constituents, each having a frequency that is the
sum and difference of five fundamental frequencies.

Shallow water tides are predicted using tide measurements made in
ports and other locations along the coast. Tidal records of just a few
months duration can be used to predict tides many years into the
future.

Tides in deep water are calculated from altimetric measurements,
especially Topex/Poseidon\index{Topex/Poseidon} measurements. As a
result, deep water tides are known almost everywhere with an
accuracy\index{accuracy!tides} approaching $\pm 2$ cm.

Tidal dissipation mixes water masses, and it is a major driver of the
deep, meridional-overturning circulation\index{circulation!meridional
overturning}. Tides, abyssal circulation, and climate are closely
linked.
